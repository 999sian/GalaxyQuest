"""Packs the scripts a player needs into one zip for the release page.

  python tools/package_converter.py [output zip]   (default: out/GalaxyQuest-converter.zip)

To play, nobody needs the source: the APK and this zip are enough.  The zip
holds the disc converter (tools/cook/cook.py with the modules it imports)
and the script that copies the converted files to the headset
(tools/push_data.py), at the paths they have here, so the commands in the
README work as they are from the unzipped folder.  They only use Python's
standard library.

The file list is checked against what the scripts import, and the zip is
the same byte for byte whenever the files are (fixed dates, sorted names).

GalaxyQuest converter
=====================

These scripts turn your own extracted Super Mario Galaxy disc into the files
the GalaxyQuest app reads, and copy them to the headset.  They need Python
3.8 or newer and nothing else.

1. Extract your disc with Dolphin: right-click the game, Properties,
   Filesystem tab, right-click the disc at the top, Extract Entire Disc...,
   into an empty folder (here "extracted").

2. Convert the game files (a few minutes, 3.3 GB), from this folder:

       python tools/cook/cook.py extracted cooked --with-movies

   Without --with-movies the prologue and ending movies are left out (2.3 GB
   less) and play as a black screen.

3. Copy them to the headset, connected over USB, with adb (the Android
   platform tools) installed and GalaxyQuest.apk already on the headset:

       python tools/push_data.py cooked

   Without adb, copy the "cooked" folder to the headset with the computer's
   file manager (for example into Download) and pick it on the app's setup
   screen.
